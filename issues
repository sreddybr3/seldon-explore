graph node is always referenced by a componentSpecs container name:
https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/issues/1960

workaround Multi-model serving without model name in CR:
if we use different models from the model sever, 
{"status":{"code":500,"info":"Failed to find model half-plus-three"}}Not
i.e. orchestrator is CR aware and is not just a proxy; 

workaround Multi-model serving with model name nad graph only:
    kubectl create -f sledon-graph-only.yaml
    Error from server (SeldonDeployment.machinelearing.seldon.io "resttfserving-grph" is invalid: spec.predictors[0].graph: 
    Invalid value: "half-plus-two": Can't find container for Predictive Unit): error when creating "sledon-graph-only.yaml": admission webhook "v1.vseldondeployment.kb.io" denied the request: SeldonDeployment.machinelearing.seldon.io "resttfserving-grph" is invalid: spec.predictors[0].graph:
